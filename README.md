Titanic Data Analysis 🚢

This project is my first Python data analysis project, where I explored and analyzed the famous Titanic dataset to understand the factors that affected passenger survival.

📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualize relationships between different features such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Passenger Class
- Fare
- Embarked Port

and how they relate to survival.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

📊 Key Analysis & Visualizations
- Age distribution of passengers  
- Survival count by gender and passenger class  
- Survival distribution by age and fare  
- Survival rate by class, sex, and embarked port  
- Correlation heatmap of the dataset  
- Relationship between Age and Fare colored by Survival  

🎯 Key Learnings
- Cleaning and exploring real-world datasets  
- Creating meaningful visualizations  
- Understanding relationships between variables  
- Improving Python and data analysis skills  

🤖 Note
ChatGPT was used as a **supporting tool** to help understand some coding concepts and improve the analysis workflow.
